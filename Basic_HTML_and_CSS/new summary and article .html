<h1>Lebron James is the GOAT</h1>

<article>
  <h2>3 reasons why Lebron James has a case of the GOAT title</h2>
  <p>For most people, they have him in the Mount Rushmore of greatest basetball players of all time. For many people that may be good enough, for others his value in the basketball debate is way higher than that.</p>
 <details>
  <summary>Champion</summary>
  <p>Lebron has 4 championship rings and 3 of those rings are from 3 different organizations. 3 different final MVPs from different organzations as well and i'm sure that hasn't been done before in the history of the game.</p>
</details> 
<details>
  <summary>Longevity</summary>
  <p>Lebron's longevity is unlike any basketball player we've ever seen. He's in his 18th year in the NBA and is still in the MVP conversation. since his second year in the league, he has been one of the best players in the league and still shows no evidence of slowing down. His stats speak for themselves. I'd advise you to do a google search on Lebron and see for yourself.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Role Model</summary>
  <p>He has spoken out about social issues, build schools and businesses, and has become a great man, father, husband etc. The things we can say about Lebron's off the court resume is insane and there's not one negative thing on his resume.</p>
